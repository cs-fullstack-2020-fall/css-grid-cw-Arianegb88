# html-grid-cw

## Score : 4/5
I would say that each of the items in the second div (your Item div) and individually underlined in the image but you can't really get that without separating the text into it's own element in your HTML file. Typically we will name classes and id starting with a lower case letter. There should be some filler text in the article section. Overall, well done!

### Problem1:
Create a site similar to cw2.png.

### Challenge:
Create 3 additional sites for Item1, Item2, and Item3 that looks the same, but has the name of the page instead of "Header".
